# Event Platform React JS Web Application

This repository contains the code for an Event Platform web application built using ReactJS. The application is designed to manage and showcase events using various APIs. Below are the instructions for setting up and running both the backend and frontend components of the application.

## Setting Up Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required Node.js modules.
3. After the installation completes, start the backend server by running `npm start`.

## Setting Up Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Once the installation is finished, run `npm start dev` to start the development server for the frontend.

## Important Note

Due to the usage of multiple APIs within the application, certain API keys are required. However, for security reasons, these keys are not included in the code repository. If you need access to the APIs used in this project (OpenAI API, Serp API, Leaflet API), please obtain your own API keys from the respective providers.
